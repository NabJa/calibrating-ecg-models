# Monte Carlo Sampling for Classification

Monte Carlo Sampling improves uncertainty estimation and calibration in ECG classification tasks.

This repository contains code to perform Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty estimation in ECG classification tasks. The implementation is based on the work by [Yarin Gal and Zoubin Ghahramani](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02142).
